### AI (Composer Assistant)

Okay, let's get this project running. Here's a breakdown of the steps and the commands you'll need to execute in your Windows PowerShell terminal. I'll guide you through setting up the environment, installing dependencies, configuring API keys, and finally running the agent.

**1. Create and Activate a Virtual Environment (Recommended)**

It's best practice to use a virtual environment to avoid conflicts with other Python projects.

```powershell
# Navigate to your project directory (deepseek-reddit-agent)
cd path\to\deepseek-reddit-agent

# Create a virtual environment named '.venv' (you can choose a different name)
python -m venv .venv

# Activate the virtual environment
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

**2. Install Dependencies**

You have a `requirements.txt` file, which makes this easy.

```powershell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
I noticed that your requirements.txt file has `langchain`, `langchain-community`, and `langchain-core`. However based on the imports in the notebook, it seems that you are using `praw`, `openai`, `beautifulsoup4`, and `python-dotenv`. I will install these packages instead.
```powershell
pip install praw openai beautifulsoup4 python-dotenv
```

**3. Set up Reddit API Credentials**

You'll need to create a Reddit application to get API credentials.

*   Go to [https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps](https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps).
*   Click "create app" or "create another app".
*   Give it a name (e.g., "GenAITrendAnalysis").
*   Choose the "script" type.
*   For the "description", you can put something like "Reddit trend analysis agent".
*   For "redirect uri", you can use `http://localhost:8080` (it doesn't matter much for this script).
*   Click "create app".

Now you'll have a client ID (listed under the app name) and a client secret.

**4. Create a .env file**
Create a `.env` file in the root of your `deepseek-reddit-agent` directory (same level as `README.md`, `Reddit-Agent.ipynb`, and `requirements.txt`). Add the following lines to your `.env` file, replacing the placeholders with your actual Reddit credentials:

```
REDDIT_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
REDDIT_USER_AGENT=your_user_agent_string
```

*   `your_client_id`: The client ID from the Reddit app you created.
*   `your_client_secret`: The client secret from the Reddit app.
*   `your_user_agent`: A unique string describing your app (e.g., "GenAITrendAnalysis by u/your_reddit_username").  It's good practice to include your Reddit username in the user agent.

**5. Configure the LLM (Important)**

The code is currently set up to use a *self-hosted* DeepSeek model via Titan Takeoff.  This is the most complex part, and you have a few options, with varying levels of difficulty:

*   **Option 1: Use the Self-Hosted DeepSeek Model (Most Complex):**  This requires you to have access to the Titan Takeoff Stack and have deployed the `DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B` model on 4xL4 GPUs.  If you *do* have this setup, you'll need to replace `<YOUR_ENDPOINT>` in the `init_llm` function with your actual endpoint URL.

*   **Option 2: Use OpenAI API (Easier):** This is the recommended approach if you don't have the self-hosting infrastructure. You'll need an OpenAI API key.  You can get one from [https://platform.openai.com/](https://platform.openai.com/).  Then:

    1.  Add your OpenAI API key to your `.env` file:
    ```
    OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
    ```
    2.  Modify the `init_llm` function in `Reddit-Agent.ipynb` to use your OpenAI key and a suitable OpenAI model.
    3.  Modify the model in `analyze_genai_relevance`, `summarize_content`, and `create_email_summary` functions.

*   **Option 3: Use Another Compatible LLM (Intermediate):** If you have another LLM accessible via an OpenAI-compatible API (many local LLM servers provide this), you can adapt Option 2. You'd set the `base_url` to your local server's address and likely set `api_key` to a dummy value (or whatever your local server requires).

Since Option 2 (OpenAI) is the most straightforward for most users, I'll provide the code modifications for that.

````python:Reddit-Agent.ipynb
def init_llm(api_key: str) -> OpenAI:
    """Initialize OpenAI LLM Note: Need access to OpenAI Key"""
    os.environ['OPENAI_API_KEY'] = api_key
    client = OpenAI(temperature=0.7)
    
    return client
````

````python:Reddit-Agent.ipynb
def analyze_genai_relevance(llm: OpenAI, title: str) -> dict:
    # ... existing code ...
    try:
        response = llm.chat.completions.create(
            model = "gpt-4", ##switch to OpenAI model (e.g. gpt-4) for OpenAI implementation
            # ... existing code ...
        )

        # Extract the response content
        response_dict = parse_llm_response(response.choices[0].message.content)
        return response_dict

    except Exception as e:
        # ... existing code ...
````

````python:Reddit-Agent.ipynb
def summarize_content(llm: OpenAI, content: str) -> str:
    # ... existing code ...
    try:
        response = llm.chat.completions.create(
            model = "gpt-4", ##switch to OpenAI model (e.g. gpt-4) for OpenAI implementation
            # ... existing code ...
        )

        # Parse the response content
        response_summary_dict = parse_llm_summary(response.choices[0].message.content)

        return response_summary_dict

    except Exception as e:
        # ... existing code ...
````

````python:Reddit-Agent.ipynb
def create_email_summary(trends_list: list, llm: OpenAI) -> str:
    # ... existing code ...
    try:
        response = llm.chat.completions.create(
            model = "gpt-4", ##switch to OpenAI model (e.g. gpt-4) for OpenAI implementation
            # ... existing code ...
        )
        llm_response = response.choices[0].message.content
        # ... existing code ...
````
I have made the following changes:
* In `init_llm`, I have removed the section for self-hosted LLM and kept the OpenAI implementation.
* In `analyze_genai_relevance`, `summarize_content`, and `create_email_summary`, I have changed the model to `"gpt-4"` and updated how the response is parsed by accessing the `content` attribute of `response.choices[0].message`.

**6. Run the Jupyter Notebook**

Finally, you can run the notebook:

```powershell
jupyter notebook Reddit-Agent.ipynb
```

This will open the notebook in your browser. You can then run all the cells (Cell -> Run All).  The last cell contains the `main` function call that executes the agent.

**Important Considerations and Troubleshooting:**

*   **Error 403 Forbidden:** The `extract_article_content` function might encounter 403 errors (as seen in your output) if websites block the scraper.  This is common.  You can try adding more robust error handling and retry logic, or potentially use a different scraping library, but some websites will be inaccessible.
*   **Rate Limiting:**  Both Reddit and OpenAI have rate limits.  If you hit these, you'll get errors.  You might need to add delays (using `time.sleep()`) in your code to avoid exceeding the limits.  The PRAW library often handles Reddit rate limits automatically, but you might need to handle OpenAI limits manually.
*   **OpenAI Costs:** Using the OpenAI API incurs costs. Be mindful of your usage, especially with `gpt-4`, which is more expensive than `gpt-3.5-turbo`. You can monitor your usage in your OpenAI account dashboard.
*   **Output Parsing:** The code relies on specific formatting from the LLM (e.g., `<think>` tags, JSON responses). If you change the LLM, you *must* ensure the prompts are designed to elicit the correct output format, and you might need to adjust the parsing functions (`parse_llm_response`, `parse_llm_summary`).  Using `gpt-4` with the provided prompts *should* work, but always check the output.
*  **Jupyter Notebook**: Make sure you have installed jupyter notebook. If not, please install it by running `pip install notebook`.

This comprehensive guide should get you up and running. Let me know if you have any more questions!

### User

for the llm, i wnat to use my nvidia nim llm api, which i have provide the code example on @llm-example.py , what are fhanges i need to made on @Reddit-Agent.ipynb 

---

### AI (Composer Assistant)

Okay, let's integrate your NVIDIA NIM LLM API into the `Reddit-Agent.ipynb` notebook. Here's a breakdown of the changes, referencing your `llm-example.py` and targeting the relevant parts of the notebook:

**1. Update `init_llm`**

This is the most crucial change. We'll replace the existing OpenAI initialization with the NVIDIA NIM initialization from your `llm-example.py`.

````python:Reddit-Agent.ipynb
def init_llm(api_key: str) -> OpenAI:
    """Initialize OpenAI LLM Note: Need access to OpenAI Key"""
    client = OpenAI(
        base_url = "https://integrate.api.nvidia.com/v1",
        api_key = api_key
    )

    return client
````

We've replaced the OpenAI client initialization with the NVIDIA client initialization.  Critically, we now pass the `api_key` parameter to the `OpenAI()` constructor, and we set the `base_url`. We also remove the `temperature` parameter, as that will be set in each call.

**2. Update API Key Handling in `.env` and the `main` Function Call**

Since your NVIDIA API key is different from an OpenAI key, we should update the `.env` file and how the key is passed to `main`.

First, update your `.env` file:

```
REDDIT_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
REDDIT_USER_AGENT=your_user_agent_string
NVIDIA_API_KEY=your_nvidia_api_key
```

Now, modify the last cell of the notebook where `main` is called:

````python:Reddit-Agent.ipynb
reddit_creds = {
    "client_id": os.getenv("REDDIT_CLIENT_ID"),
    "client_secret": os.getenv("REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET"),
    "user_agent": os.getenv("REDDIT_USER_AGENT")
}

nvidia_api_key = os.getenv("NVIDIA_API_KEY")

result = main(reddit_creds, nvidia_api_key)
````

This reads the NVIDIA API key from the environment variable.

**3. Update LLM Calls (`analyze_genai_relevance`, `summarize_content`, `create_email_summary`)**

You'll need to update the `model` parameter and how you access the response content in each of these functions.  You'll also need to add the `temperature` and `top_p` parameters, as shown in your `llm-example.py`.

````python:Reddit-Agent.ipynb
def analyze_genai_relevance(llm: OpenAI, title: str) -> dict:
    # ... existing code ...
    try:
        response = llm.chat.completions.create(
            model="meta/llama-3.1-405b-instruct",
            messages=[
                {"role": "system", "content": system_prompt},
                {"role": "user", "content\": title}
            ],
            temperature=0.2,
            top_p=0.7,
            max_tokens=2000
        )

        # Extract the response content
        response_dict = parse_llm_response(response.choices[0].message.content)
        return response_dict

    except Exception as e:
        # ... existing code ...
````

````python:Reddit-Agent.ipynb
def summarize_content(llm: OpenAI, content: str) -> str:
    # ... existing code ...
    try:
        response = llm.chat.completions.create(
            model="meta/llama-3.1-405b-instruct",
            messages=[
                {"role": "system", "content\": system_prompt},
                {"role": "user", "content\": content}
            ],
            temperature=0.2,
            top_p=0.7,
            max_tokens=2000
        )

        # Parse the response content
        response_summary_dict = parse_llm_summary(response.choices[0].message.content)

        return response_summary_dict

    except Exception as e:
        # ... existing code ...
````

````python:Reddit-Agent.ipynb
def create_email_summary(trends_list: list, llm: OpenAI) -> str:
    # ... existing code ...
    try:
        response = llm.chat.completions.create(
            model="meta/llama-3.1-405b-instruct",
            messages=[
                {"role": "system", "content\": system_prompt},
                {"role": "user", "content\": formatted_input}
            ],
            temperature=0.2,
            top_p=0.7,
            max_tokens=2000
        )
        llm_response = response.choices[0].message.content
        # ... existing code ...
````

In each of these, we've:

*   Changed `model` to `"meta/llama-3.1-405b-instruct"`.
*   Added `temperature=0.2` and `top_p=0.7`.
*   Changed how we access the response: `response.choices[0].message.content` instead of `.text`.

**4. Update `init_llm` call in `RedditAIAnalysisAgent`**

Update the `initialize_clients` method within the `RedditAIAnalysisAgent` class to use the `NVIDIA_API_KEY`:

````python:Reddit-Agent.ipynb
class RedditAIAnalysisAgent:
    # ... existing code ...

    def initialize_clients(self) -> bool:
        # ... existing code ...
        try:
            # ... existing code ...

            self.llm = init_llm(self.openai_api_key)
            self.act("Initialize LLM client", "✅ LLM client initialized successfully.")

            return True

        except Exception as e:
            # ... existing code ...
````

And change the result message to reflect the successful initialization.

**5. Remove Stream Parameter**
The `stream=True` parameter is used for streaming responses, which is useful for interactive applications where you want to display the output as it's generated. However, in this case, the responses are processed after they are fully received. Remove the `stream` parameter from the `llm-example.py` file.

**Complete Summary of Changes and Explanations:**

1.  **`init_llm` Modification:** We adapted the `init_llm` function to use the NVIDIA NIM API, taking the API key as input and setting the correct base URL. This ensures the code connects to the NVIDIA endpoint.

2.  **API Key Handling:** We updated the `.env` file to use `NVIDIA_API_KEY` and modified the code to read this variable, ensuring the correct API key is used.

3.  **LLM Call Updates:** We updated the `model`, added `temperature` and `top_p` parameters, and corrected the response access method in `analyze_genai_relevance`, `summarize_content`, and `create_email_summary`. This aligns the code with the NVIDIA API's requirements.

4.  **`initialize_clients` Update:** We ensured the `initialize_clients` method in the `RedditAIAnalysisAgent` class correctly calls `init_llm` with the NVIDIA API key.

5. **Remove Stream Parameter:** Removed `stream=True` from the example code.

These changes should correctly configure your `Reddit-Agent.ipynb` to use the NVIDIA NIM LLM API. Remember to restart your Jupyter kernel after making these changes to ensure they take effect.

Okay, you're encountering an SSL certificate verification error. This is a common issue, and it usually means your Python environment is having trouble verifying Reddit's SSL certificate. It's *not* related to the LLM changes we made. Here's a breakdown of the problem and how to fix it, along with explanations:

**The Problem: SSL Certificate Verification**

When your script tries to connect to Reddit (using `praw`), it's making an HTTPS request. HTTPS uses SSL/TLS certificates to ensure the connection is secure. Your Python installation has a set of trusted root certificates. The error `CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED` means that Python can't find a trusted certificate in its store that matches the certificate presented by Reddit. This can happen for a few reasons:

*   **Missing or Outdated Root Certificates:** Your system's (or Python's) root certificate store might be outdated or incomplete.
*   **Corporate Firewall/Proxy:** If you're on a corporate network, your company's firewall or proxy might be intercepting SSL traffic and replacing Reddit's certificate with its own. This is common for security reasons, but it can break Python's certificate verification.
* **Incorrect System Time:** If your computer's system time is significantly off, it can cause certificate validation issues.
* **Python using the wrong certificate store:** Sometimes, Python might not be looking in the correct location for certificates.

**Solutions (from best to worst):**

1.  **Fixing the Root Certificate Issue (Best Solution):**

    *   **Identify the `certifi` path:** The `praw` library uses the `certifi` package to manage certificates. We need to find where `certifi` is installed. Run this in your activated environment:

        ```powershell
        python -c "import certifi; print(certifi.where())"
        ```

        This will print the full path to the `cacert.pem` file (the bundle of trusted certificates).  Example output: `C:\...\.venv\Lib\site-packages\certifi\cacert.pem`

    *   **Download the latest `cacert.pem`:** Download the latest `cacert.pem` from the official source: [https://curl.se/docs/caextract.html](https://curl.se/docs/caextract.html).  Click the "cacert.pem" link to download it.

    *   **Replace the existing `cacert.pem`:**  *Replace* the file at the path you found in the first step with the one you just downloaded.  Make a backup of the original `cacert.pem` first, just in case.

    * **Test:** Run your `Reddit-Agent.ipynb` notebook again. This should resolve the issue if it's due to outdated certificates.

2.  **Using a System-Wide Certificate Store (If applicable):**

    If you're on a corporate network and *know* that your company uses a custom root certificate, you might need to tell Python to use the system's certificate store instead of `certifi`. This is less portable (your code won't work outside the corporate network without modification), but it's often the correct solution in this scenario.

    *   **Find your system certificate store:** The location varies depending on your operating system.  On Windows, it's usually managed by the operating system itself.
    *   **Set the `REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE` environment variable:**  You can tell the `requests` library (which `praw` uses) to use a specific certificate bundle by setting the `REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE` environment variable.  *However*, on Windows, `requests` will automatically use the system certificate store if `REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE` is *not* set.  So, the solution here is often to *unset* this variable if you've accidentally set it.

        ```powershell
        # Check if it's set (in PowerShell)
        $env:REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE

        # If it's set, unset it:
        Remove-Item Env:\REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE
        ```

    *   **Set `SSL_CERT_FILE` (Alternative):**  You can also try setting the `SSL_CERT_FILE` environment variable. This is a more general Python setting.

        ```powershell
        #  You usually DON'T need to set this on Windows, but if you do:
        #  $env:SSL_CERT_FILE = "path/to/your/system/cert/file.pem"  #  Replace with the actual path
        ```

    *   **Test:**  Try running your notebook again.

3.  **Disabling SSL Verification (WORST, NOT RECOMMENDED):**

    *This is strongly discouraged for security reasons.*  It disables the checks that ensure you're connecting to the real Reddit and not a malicious imposter.  *Only* use this as a temporary debugging step, and *never* in production.

    You can disable verification in `praw` by passing `verify=False` to the `requests` session.  However, the way `praw` is initialized in the notebook, there isn't a direct way to do this. The cleanest way to do this (still *not* recommended) is to temporarily monkey-patch the `requests.get` function.  Add this *temporarily* to the `extract_article_content` function, right before the `requests.get` call:

    
```139:139:Reddit-Agent.ipynb
    "\n",
```


    ```python
    # TEMPORARY HACK: Disable SSL verification (DANGEROUS)
    import requests
    original_get = requests.get
    requests.get = lambda *args, **kwargs: original_get(*args, **kwargs, verify=False)
    response = requests.get(url, headers=headers, timeout=10)
    requests.get = original_get  # Restore the original function
    ```

    This replaces the `requests.get` function with a version that disables verification, calls the original function, and then restores the original function.  Again, this is *only* for temporary debugging.

**Troubleshooting Steps:**

1.  **Start with Solution 1 (Update `certifi`):** This is the most likely fix and the safest.
2.  **If that doesn't work, try Solution 2 (System Certificates):** This is relevant if you're on a corporate network.
3.  **As a *last resort*, try Solution 3 (Disable Verification):** Use this *only* to confirm that SSL verification is the problem, then immediately revert to one of the other solutions.
4. **Check System Time:** Make sure your computer's clock is set correctly.

The error message you're seeing is almost certainly related to SSL certificate verification, and these steps should help you resolve it. The most likely and best solution is to update your `certifi` bundle.

yes i do have theD:\Projects\forks\deepseek-reddit-agent\deepseek-reddit-agent\.venv\Lib\site-packages\certifi\cacert.pem

and which certificates do i need to download ( there's so many differnet link/downloader with different version )

### AI (Composer Assistant)

You need the plain "cacert.pem" file, which is a bundle of trusted root certificates. Here's how to get the correct one and the steps to replace it:

**1. Download the Correct `cacert.pem`**

*   Go to this URL: [https://curl.se/docs/caextract.html](https://curl.se/docs/caextract.html)
*   Click on the link that says **"cacert.pem"** (it should be the first link under "Plain PEM"). *Do not* click on any of the links with "sha256" or "der" or other extensions. Just the plain `cacert.pem`.
*   This will download a file named `cacert.pem`.

**2. Replace the Existing `cacert.pem`**

*   You already found the correct path: `D:\Projects\forks\deepseek-reddit-agent\deepseek-reddit-agent\.venv\Lib\site-packages\certifi\cacert.pem`
*   **Important: Make a Backup:** Before replacing the file, make a copy of the *existing* `cacert.pem` file and rename it to something like `cacert.pem.bak`. This way, you can easily revert if something goes wrong.
*   **Copy the Downloaded File:** Copy the `cacert.pem` file you just downloaded into the `D:\Projects\forks\deepseek-reddit-agent\deepseek-reddit-agent\.venv\Lib\site-packages\certifi\` directory, *replacing* the existing `cacert.pem` file.

**3. Restart and Test**

*   **Restart your Jupyter kernel:** This is important to ensure the changes are loaded. In your Jupyter Notebook, go to "Kernel" -> "Restart & Clear Output".
*   **Run your notebook:** Run all the cells in your `Reddit-Agent.ipynb` notebook again. The SSL error should now be gone.

**Explanation:**

The `cacert.pem` file contains a list of Certificate Authorities (CAs) that your Python installation trusts. When you connect to a website via HTTPS (like Reddit), the website presents a certificate. Python checks if that certificate was issued by a CA listed in `cacert.pem`. If it can't find a matching trusted CA, you get the `CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED` error. The `curl.se` website provides an up-to-date bundle of these trusted CA certificates, extracted from the Mozilla Firefox browser. By replacing the old `cacert.pem` with the new one, you're updating your Python environment's list of trusted CAs.

This is the most reliable and secure way to fix the SSL verification error. It ensures that your connections are properly secured while avoiding the risks of disabling verification.

Okay, the error has changed from an `SSLError` (certificate verification) to a `ConnectTimeoutError`. This means we successfully addressed the certificate issue, but now the script is failing to connect to `www.reddit.com` within the allowed time. Let's analyze this new error and find solutions, using the provided search results.

**Understanding `ConnectTimeoutError`**

The `ConnectTimeoutError` means that your script tried to establish a connection to Reddit's servers (`www.reddit.com`), but the server didn't respond within the specified timeout period.  This *doesn't* mean Reddit is down; it means something is preventing *your script* from reaching Reddit.  Here are the common causes, prioritized by likelihood in your situation:

1.  **Network Connectivity Issues:**
    *   **General Internet Connection:**  The most basic check: Is your internet connection working at all? Can you browse other websites?
    *   **Temporary Network Glitch:** Sometimes, temporary network hiccups can cause connection timeouts.
    *   **Firewall:** A firewall (either on your computer or on your network) might be blocking the connection to Reddit. This is more likely in a corporate environment.
    * **DNS Resolution Problems:** Your computer might be having trouble resolving the domain name `www.reddit.com` to an IP address.

2.  **Proxy Issues:**
    *   **Incorrect Proxy Settings:** If you're using a proxy server (again, more common in corporate environments), the proxy settings might be incorrect, or the proxy server itself might be down. The search results from [urllib3.readthedocs.io](https://urllib3.readthedocs.io/en/1.26.x/advanced-usage.html) highlight the importance of having `http://` and not `https://` in proxy environment variables.
    *   **Proxy Interference:** Even if you don't *think* you're using a proxy, some software or network configurations can automatically set proxy settings.

3.  **Reddit Being Blocked (Less Likely, but Possible):**
    *   **Intentional Blocking:**  It's possible (though less likely in a home environment) that Reddit is being intentionally blocked by your network administrator or ISP.
    * **Accidental Blocking:** Security software (antivirus, etc.) could be mistakenly identifying Reddit traffic as malicious.

4. **Server-Side Issues (Least Likely):**
    * While it is possible that Reddit is experiencing temporary issues, it is unlikely to be the root cause, given that the error is a *connection* timeout on your end.

**Troubleshooting and Solutions (in order of what to try):**

1.  **Basic Network Checks:**

    *   **Verify Internet:** Can you open other websites (e.g., `google.com`) in your browser? If not, the problem is with your general internet connection.
    *   **Try a Different Network (If Possible):** If you can, try connecting to a different network (e.g., your mobile hotspot) to see if the problem persists. This helps isolate whether the issue is with your primary network.

2.  **Check and Adjust Timeout:**

    *   **Where is the timeout set?** The timeout is likely being set implicitly by `praw` (which uses `requests`, which in turn uses `urllib3`). We can try to increase it.  The `requests` library allows setting timeouts.  We can't *directly* control the timeout used by `praw`'s internal `requests` session, but we can try a workaround.
    *   **Monkey-patch `requests.Session.request` (Careful Approach):** We can temporarily modify the `request` method of `requests.Session` to increase the timeout.  This is similar to the previous monkey-patching, but we're targeting a different part of the `requests` library. Add this code *temporarily* within the `get_reddit_trends` function, *before* the loop that iterates through submissions:

    ```python
    import requests
    import functools

    original_request = requests.Session.request

    @functools.wraps(original_request)
    def patched_request(self, method, url, *args, **kwargs):
        # Increase timeout.  (connect, read) in seconds.
        kwargs['timeout'] = (30, 60)  # 30s connect, 60s read
        return original_request(self, method, url, *args, **kwargs)

    requests.Session.request = patched_request

    # ... (rest of your get_reddit_trends function) ...

    # Restore the original request method after the loop:
    requests.Session.request = original_request
    ```
     This code does the following:
        1.  Imports `requests` and `functools`.
        2.  Stores the original `requests.Session.request` method.
        3.  Defines a new function `patched_request` that:
            *   Takes the same arguments as the original `request` method.
            *   Sets the `timeout` keyword argument to `(30, 60)` (30 seconds for connection, 60 seconds for reading data). You can adjust these values.
            *   Calls the *original* `request` method with the modified arguments.
        4.  Replaces `requests.Session.request` with our `patched_request`.
        5.  *Crucially*, after the loop that uses `praw`, it *restores* the original `requests.Session.request` method. This is very important to avoid unintended side effects.

3.  **Proxy Checks (If Applicable):**

    *   **Check Environment Variables:** In your PowerShell, run:

        ```powershell
        env | grep "_PROXY"
        ```

        Look for `HTTP_PROXY`, `HTTPS_PROXY`, and `ALL_PROXY`.  If any of these are set, make sure they start with `http://` and *not* `https://`, as emphasized in the [urllib3 documentation](https://urllib3.readthedocs.io/en/1.26.x/advanced-usage.html). If they are incorrect, unset them or correct them:

        ```powershell
        # Example (if HTTPS_PROXY is incorrect):
        $env:HTTPS_PROXY = "http://your.proxy.address:port"  # Correct
        # OR, to unset it:
        Remove-Item Env:\HTTPS_PROXY
        ```

    *   **Check System Proxy Settings (Windows):** Search for "Proxy settings" in the Windows search bar. Check if a proxy is configured there. If it is, and you don't need it for general internet access, try turning it off *temporarily* to see if it resolves the issue.

    *   **Check `urllib.request.getproxies()`:** Run this in a Python shell (within your activated environment):

        ```python
        python -c "import urllib.request; print(urllib.request.getproxies())"
        ```

        If this returns any proxy settings, and you're *not* expecting to be using a proxy, it indicates that a system-level proxy is configured. You'll need to adjust your system settings (as described above) or configure your script to work with the proxy.

4.  **Firewall/Security Software:**

    *   **Temporarily Disable Firewall:** *Temporarily* disable your computer's firewall (e.g., Windows Firewall) and any third-party security software to see if it's blocking the connection. If this solves the problem, you'll need to configure your firewall/security software to allow connections to `www.reddit.com`.
    *   **Check Firewall Logs:** If you're comfortable with it, check your firewall logs to see if there are any entries related to blocking connections to Reddit.

5. **DNS Issues**
    *   **Flush DNS Cache:** In PowerShell, run:
        ```powershell
        ipconfig /flushdns
        ```
    * **Try a different DNS Server:** You can try changing your DNS server to a public DNS server like Google DNS (8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4) or Cloudflare DNS (1.1.1.1 and 1.0.0.1). This is usually done in your network adapter settings.

**Recap and Prioritized Steps:**

1.  **Verify basic internet connectivity.**
2.  **Increase the timeout using the monkey-patching technique within `get_reddit_trends`.**
3.  **Check for and correct/disable any proxy settings (environment variables and system settings).**
4.  **Temporarily disable your firewall/security software.**
5.  **Flush your DNS cache and/or try a different DNS server.**

By systematically working through these steps, you should be able to identify the cause of the `ConnectTimeoutError` and get your script working. The most likely culprits are network issues, incorrect proxy settings, or an overly restrictive timeout. Remember to undo any temporary changes (like disabling the firewall or monkey-patching) once you've identified the problem.

### AI (Composer Assistant)

You're back to the original `SSLCertVerificationError`, even after replacing the `cacert.pem` file. This is perplexing, but it strongly suggests that the updated `certifi` bundle *isn't* being used. Here's a refined troubleshooting approach, incorporating insights from the search results and focusing on ensuring the correct certificate bundle is loaded:

**Key Observations and Strategy:**

*   **Inconsistent Behavior:** The error switching back to `SSLCertVerificationError` after a `ConnectTimeoutError` indicates that the environment is not consistently using the updated `certifi`.
*   **Windows Specifics:** Several search results ([stackoverflow.com](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/77442172/ssl-certificate-verify-failed-certificate-verify-failed-unable-to-get-local-is)) point out that solutions like `SSL_CERT_FILE` *do* work on Windows, despite some claims to the contrary.  We need to be more aggressive in checking environment variables.
*   **Corporate Environment:** You mentioned earlier that this might be a work environment. Corporate proxies and security software (like Zscaler, mentioned in a Stack Overflow answer) are *highly* likely to be interfering.
* **`pip-system-certs`:** Several answers suggest using `pip-system-certs` ([stackoverflow.com](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/77442172/ssl-certificate-verify-failed-certificate-verify-failed-unable-to-get-local-is)). This is worth trying.

**Troubleshooting Steps (Prioritized):**

1.  **Verify `certifi.where()` *Within the Notebook*:**

    *   **The most important step:** Add the following line *directly within your `Reddit-Agent.ipynb` notebook*, in a cell *before* you call `main()` (or any PRAW-related code):

        ```python
        import certifi
        print(certifi.where())
        ```

    *   **Run *only* that cell.**  Do *not* run the entire notebook yet.  This will show you *exactly* which `cacert.pem` file `praw` is *actually* using at runtime.  It *must* be the path to the one you modified in your virtual environment. If it's *not*, that's the core of the problem.

2.  **Check and Unset Conflicting Environment Variables:**

    *   **Thorough Check:** In your PowerShell (within the activated environment), run:

        ```powershell
        Get-ChildItem Env: | Where-Object {$_.Name -like "*SSL*" -or $_.Name -like "*CERT*" -or $_.Name -like "*PROXY*"}
        ```

        This will list *all* environment variables containing "SSL", "CERT", or "PROXY" (case-insensitive).  Look carefully for:
        *   `REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE`: If set, *unset* it (as discussed before).  On Windows, `requests` should use the system store by default.
        *   `SSL_CERT_FILE`: If set, it *might* be interfering.  Note its value, then *unset* it temporarily.
        *   `SSL_CERT_DIR`:  Similar to `SSL_CERT_FILE`. Note and temporarily unset.
        *   `HTTP_PROXY`, `HTTPS_PROXY`, `ALL_PROXY`:  If set, ensure they are correct (using `http://`, not `https://`). If you don't *need* a proxy, unset them temporarily.

    *   **Unsetting (PowerShell):**

        ```powershell
        Remove-Item Env:\REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE  # Example - repeat for others
        ```

    *   **Restart Kernel:** After changing environment variables, *restart your Jupyter kernel* ("Kernel" -> "Restart & Clear Output").

3.  **Install `pip-system-certs` (with `--use-feature=truststore`):**

    *   This is a good option, especially if you're on a system where you don't have full control over certificates.  In your activated environment:

        ```powershell
        pip install pip-system-certs --use-feature=truststore
        ```
    * **Restart Kernel:** Restart your Jupyter kernel.

4.  **Corporate Proxy/VPN/Security Software (Zscaler, Cloudflare, etc.):**

    *   **If you are on a corporate network, this is the *most likely* cause.**  The search results mention Zscaler specifically.  These tools often intercept SSL traffic and require their own certificates.
    *   **Identify Interception:** If you can, determine if your company uses Zscaler, Cloudflare, or a similar SSL inspection tool.
    *   **Obtain Corporate Certificate:** You'll likely need to obtain your company's root CA certificate (usually a `.crt` or `.pem` file).  Your IT department should be able to provide this.
    *   **`SSL_CERT_FILE` (with Corporate Cert):** Once you have the corporate certificate, set the `SSL_CERT_FILE` environment variable to point to it:

        ```powershell
        $env:SSL_CERT_FILE = "C:\path\to\your\corporate_cert.pem"  # Replace with the actual path
        ```
        Then, restart your Jupyter kernel.

    *   **`pip-system-certs` (Alternative):**  `pip-system-certs` *might* automatically pick up the corporate certificate if it's installed in the Windows system certificate store.  It's worth trying *after* installing `pip-system-certs`.

5.  **Monkey-Patching (as a Diagnostic Tool):**

    *   If *none* of the above works, use the monkey-patching technique from the previous response (disabling SSL verification) *only* to confirm that SSL verification is *still* the issue.  If it works with verification disabled, it confirms the problem is certificate-related, but you *must* then find a proper solution (don't leave verification disabled).

**Why this approach is different:**

*   **`certifi.where()` inside the notebook:** This is crucial for verifying which certificate bundle is *actually* being used at runtime.
*   **Aggressive Environment Variable Check:** We're being much more thorough in checking for *any* environment variable that might interfere.
*   **`pip-system-certs`:** This is a recommended solution from multiple sources.
*   **Corporate Environment Focus:** We're explicitly addressing the likely scenario of corporate SSL interception.

By following these steps, you should be able to pinpoint the exact cause of the persistent `SSLCertVerificationError` and implement the correct solution. The most likely issues are either an incorrect `certifi` path being used, conflicting environment variables, or interference from corporate security software.

Okay, the `certifi.where()` output confirms that the correct `cacert.pem` *should* be used. The fact that you're still getting the `SSLCertVerificationError`, *and* you suspect Reddit is blocked in your country (Indonesia), significantly changes the likely cause and solution.

**The Problem: Likely Government-Level Blocking (with SSL Interception)**

If Reddit is blocked at the national level in Indonesia, it's highly probable that the blocking mechanism involves some form of SSL interception. This means:

1.  **DNS Blocking:** Your ISP (Internet Service Provider) is likely blocking access to Reddit's IP addresses via DNS. When you try to access `www.reddit.com`, your computer can't get the correct IP address.
2.  **SSL Interception:** Even if you bypass DNS blocking (e.g., by using Cloudflare DNS), the blocking mechanism might be intercepting SSL connections. They might be presenting a *different* SSL certificate than the legitimate Reddit certificate. This is why you're still getting the `SSLCertVerificationError`, even with the updated `cacert.pem`.

**Solutions (Focus on Circumventing Blocking):**

1.  **VPN (Virtual Private Network) - Most Reliable:**

    *   **How it Works:** A VPN encrypts your internet traffic and routes it through a server in a different location (where Reddit isn't blocked). This bypasses both DNS blocking and SSL interception.
    *   **Recommendation:** Use a reputable VPN provider with servers in a country where Reddit is accessible (e.g., the US, Canada, many European countries).
    *   **Implementation:**
        1.  Choose a VPN provider and install their software.
        2.  Connect to a VPN server in a suitable location.
        3.  Run your `Reddit-Agent.ipynb` notebook. It should now work without SSL errors.

2.  **Cloudflare DNS (1.1.1.1) - May Help with DNS, but Not SSL Interception:**

    *   **How it Works:** Cloudflare DNS (1.1.1.1) is a public DNS resolver that can sometimes bypass DNS-based blocking. However, it *won't* help if the blocking involves SSL interception.
    *   **Implementation:**
        1.  **Change DNS Settings:** Go to your network adapter settings (in Windows, search for "View network connections").
        2.  Right-click on your active network adapter (Wi-Fi or Ethernet) and select "Properties."
        3.  Select "Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4)" and click "Properties."
        4.  Select "Use the following DNS server addresses:"
        5.  Enter `1.1.1.1` for "Preferred DNS server" and `1.0.0.1` for "Alternate DNS server."
        6.  Click "OK" to save the changes.
        7.  **Flush DNS Cache:** Open PowerShell and run `ipconfig /flushdns`.
        8.  **Restart Jupyter Kernel:** Restart your Jupyter kernel.
        9.  **Test:** Try running your notebook. If the blocking is *only* DNS-based, this might work. But if there's SSL interception, it won't.

3.  **Tor Browser (For Browsing, Not Ideal for Scripting):**

    *   **How it Works:** Tor is a network that anonymizes your traffic and routes it through multiple relays, making it very difficult to block.
    *   **Limitations:** While Tor is excellent for browsing blocked websites, it's *not* well-suited for use with `praw` and your script. Integrating `praw` with Tor is complex and unreliable.  Use a VPN instead for your script.

4. **Proxy (Less Reliable than VPN):**
    * A proxy server *could* potentially bypass the block, but it's less reliable and secure than a VPN. If you choose to use a proxy, make sure it's a reputable one that supports HTTPS and is located in a country where Reddit is accessible. You would need to configure `requests` (and therefore `praw`) to use the proxy. This is more complex than using a VPN.

**Why the Previous Steps Didn't Work:**

*   **`cacert.pem` Replacement:** This would have fixed a genuine certificate issue *if* the problem was with your local certificate store. However, the problem is likely government-level SSL interception, which replaces Reddit's certificate with a different one.
*   **Environment Variables:** While checking environment variables is good practice, they weren't the root cause in this case.

**Prioritized Recommendations:**

1.  **Use a VPN:** This is the most reliable and secure solution for accessing blocked websites, especially when SSL interception is involved.
2.  **Try Cloudflare DNS:** This is easy to set up and *might* work if the blocking is only DNS-based, but it's unlikely to be sufficient.
3. **Avoid Tor for scripting.**
4. **Avoid proxies unless you have a very good reason and understand the security implications.**

The key takeaway is that if a website is blocked at the national level, technical workarounds like changing certificate files are unlikely to work. You need a solution that circumvents the blocking mechanism itself, and a VPN is the best option for that.

### AI (Composer Assistant)

Okay, now that you're using a VPN and the connection errors are gone, we're dealing with a different issue: a `KeyError: 'is_genai_related'` within your `analyze_trends` function. This means the `response` dictionary returned by `analyze_genai_relevance` *doesn't* contain the expected `'is_genai_related'` key. This points to a problem with either the LLM's response or the parsing of that response.

Let's break down the problem and how to fix it:

**1. Where the Error Occurs**

The error happens in `get_reddit_trends`, specifically in this line:

```python
print(f"GenAI Relevance: {relevance['response']['is_genai_related']}")
```

This line tries to access `relevance['response']['is_genai_related']`. The `KeyError` means that either `relevance['response']` doesn't exist, or it *does* exist, but it doesn't contain an `'is_genai_related'` key. Since you're getting *past* the `relevance = analyze_genai_relevance(...)` line without error, we know `relevance` itself is being returned. The problem is the structure of the dictionary it contains.

**2. Examining `analyze_genai_relevance` and `parse_llm_response`**

These are the two functions involved in generating and processing the LLM's response:

```python
def analyze_genai_relevance(llm: OpenAI, title: str) -> dict:
    """Analyze if title is GenAI-related using LLM"""

    system_prompt = """You are a helpful AI assistant. Based on the title 
    of the article provide a suggestion if this content relates to Generative AI:
    
    Return JSON:
        {
            "is_genai_related": true/false,
            "relevance_type": "direct/indirect/none",
        }"""    
    try:
        response = llm.chat.completions.create(
            model = "meta/llama-3.1-405b-instruct", ##switch to OpenAI model (e.g. gpt-4) for OpenAI implementation 
            messages=[
                {"role": "system", "content": system_prompt},
                {"role": "user", "content": title}
            ],
            temperature=0.2,
            top_p=0.7,
            max_tokens=2000
        )
        
        # Extract the response content
        response_dict = parse_llm_response(response.choices[0].message.content)
        return response_dict
        
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error in GenAI relevance: {str(e)}")
        return "" # This is a problem!

def parse_llm_response(response_text: str) -> dict:
    """
    Parse LLM response to separate thinking process and JSON response from 
    analyze_genai_relevance()
    """
    # Pattern for think tags
    think_pattern = r'<think>(.*?)</think>'
    
    # Pattern for JSON (anything between triple backticks and json)
    json_pattern = r'```json\n(.*?)```'
    
    # Extract thinking process
    thinking = re.search(think_pattern, response_text, re.DOTALL)
    thinking = thinking.group(1).strip() if thinking else ""
    
    # Extract JSON response
    json_match = re.search(json_pattern, response_text, re.DOTALL)
    json_str = json_match.group(1).strip() if json_match else "{}"
    json_data = json.loads(json_str)
    
    return {
        "thinking": thinking,
        "response": json_data
    }
```

**3. Potential Problems and Solutions**

*   **Problem 1: LLM Not Returning JSON:** The most likely issue is that the LLM is *not* returning a response in the exact JSON format you specified in the `system_prompt`.  LLMs, especially self-hosted ones, can be sensitive to prompt wording. Even small deviations from the expected format can cause parsing errors.
*   **Problem 2: Incorrect Parsing:** The `parse_llm_response` function relies on specific patterns (`<think>` tags and triple backticks with `json`). If the LLM doesn't include these, the parsing will fail. The `json.loads("{}")` will create an *empty* dictionary if no JSON is found, which would lead to the `KeyError`.
* **Problem 3: Empty/Error Return from `analyze_genai_relevance`:** The `except` block in `analyze_genai_relevance` returns an *empty string* (`""`) if there's an error during the LLM call. This is a major problem because the calling function (`get_reddit_trends`) expects a *dictionary*.

**Solutions (Prioritized):**

1.  **Robust Error Handling and Default Values:**

    *   **Modify `analyze_genai_relevance`:** Change the `except` block to return a *dictionary* with default values, indicating an error.  This prevents the `KeyError` and provides more information.

        ```python:Reddit-Agent.ipynb
        def analyze_genai_relevance(llm: OpenAI, title: str) -> dict:
            # ... existing code ...
            try:
                # ... existing code ...
            except Exception as e:
                print(f"Error in GenAI relevance: {str(e)}")
                return {  # Return a dictionary with default values
                    "thinking": "",
                    "response": {
                        "is_genai_related": False,
                        "relevance_type": "none"
                    }
                }
        ```

    *   **Modify `parse_llm_response`:** Add error handling and default values to handle cases where the JSON parsing fails.

        ```python:Reddit-Agent.ipynb
        def parse_llm_response(response_text: str) -> dict:
            # ... existing code ...
            try:
                json_data = json.loads(json_str)
            except json.JSONDecodeError:
                print(f"Error: Invalid JSON returned from LLM: {response_text}")
                json_data = {"is_genai_related": False, "relevance_type": "none"}

            return {
                "thinking": thinking,
                "response": json_data
            }
        ```
        This tries to parse the JSON, and if it fails (due to a `json.JSONDecodeError`), it prints an error message and sets `json_data` to a default dictionary.

2.  **Inspect the LLM Response (Debugging):**

    *   **Print `response_text`:**  *Temporarily* add a print statement inside `parse_llm_response` to see the *raw* response from the LLM:

        ```python
        def parse_llm_response(response_text: str) -> dict:
            print(f"Raw LLM response: {response_text}") # Add this line
            # ... rest of the function ...
        ```

    *   **Examine the Output:** Run your notebook and carefully examine the printed `response_text`.  Is it valid JSON? Does it contain the `"is_genai_related"` key?  This will tell you if the problem is with the LLM's output or your parsing logic.

3.  **Adjust the Prompt (If Necessary):**

    *   If the LLM is consistently not returning the correct JSON format, you might need to adjust the `system_prompt` in `analyze_genai_relevance`.  Here are some tips:
        *   **Be Extremely Explicit:**  Reiterate the desired format.
        *   **Provide an Example:** Include a sample JSON response in the prompt.
        *   **Use Stronger Wording:** Instead of "provide a suggestion," use "You MUST return a JSON object with the following keys..."
        * **Simplify the prompt:** Sometimes a simpler prompt can work better.

        ```python
        system_prompt = """You are a helpful AI assistant. You MUST return a JSON object with the following keys and values:

        {
            "is_genai_related": true or false,
            "relevance_type": "direct", "indirect", or "none"
        }

        Based on the title of the article, determine if the content relates to Generative AI.

        Example:

        Input Title: "New AI Model Generates Realistic Images"

        Output JSON:
        {
            "is_genai_related": true,
            "relevance_type": "direct"
        }
        """
        ```

4. **Consider not using JSON in the prompt:**
    * The LLM might be better at returning simple strings. You could change the prompt to ask for a simple "yes" or "no" response, and then convert that to a boolean in your Python code.

**Revised Code (with error handling and debugging):**

```python:Reddit-Agent.ipynb
def analyze_genai_relevance(llm: OpenAI, title: str) -> dict:
    """Analyze if title is GenAI-related using LLM"""

        }"""    
    try:
        response = llm.chat.completions.create(
            model = "meta/llama-3.1-405b-instruct", ##switch to OpenAI model (e.g. gpt-4) for OpenAI implementation 
            messages=[

                {"role": "user", "content": title}
            ],
            temperature=0.2,
            top_p=0.7,
            max_tokens=2000
        )
        
        # Extract the response content
        response_dict = parse_llm_response(response.choices[0].message.content)
        return response_dict

                "is_genai_related": False,
                "relevance_type": "none"
            }
        }

def parse_llm_response(response_text: str) -> dict:
    """
    Parse LLM response to separate thinking process and JSON response from 
    analyze_genai_relevance()
    """
    print(f"Raw LLM response: {response_text}") # Add this line for debugging

    # Pattern for think tags
    think_pattern = r'<think>(.*?)</think>'
    
    # Pattern for JSON (anything between triple backticks and json)
    json_pattern = r'```json\n(.*?)```'
    
    # Extract thinking process
    thinking = re.search(think_pattern, response_text, re.DOTALL)
    thinking = thinking.group(1).strip() if thinking else ""
    
    # Extract JSON response
    json_match = re.search(json_pattern, response_text, re.DOTALL)
    json_str = json_match.group(1).strip() if json_match else "{}"
    
    try:
        json_data = json.loads(json_str)
    except json.JSONDecodeError:
        print(f"Error: Invalid JSON returned from LLM: {response_text}")
        json_data = {"is_genai_related": False, "relevance_type": "none"} # Default values

    return {
        "thinking": thinking,
        "response": json_data
    }
```

**Steps to Debug:**

1.  **Implement the error handling:** Add the `try...except` blocks to both `analyze_genai_relevance` and `parse_llm_response` as shown above.
2.  **Add the print statement:** Add `print(f"Raw LLM response: {response_text}")` to `parse_llm_response`.
3.  **Run the notebook:** Run your notebook and examine the output. Look at the raw LLM response.
4.  **Adjust the prompt (if needed):** If the LLM response is not valid JSON or doesn't contain the required key, modify the `system_prompt` as described above.
5.  **Remove the print statement:** Once you've identified and fixed the problem, remove the temporary `print` statement.

By adding error handling and inspecting the raw LLM response, you'll be able to quickly determine whether the issue is with the LLM's output or your parsing logic and fix it accordingly. The most important change is to return a dictionary with default values in case of errors, preventing the `KeyError`.

        "response": json_data
    }
```

Okay, we're *very* close now. The raw LLM response *is* valid JSON, and it *does* contain the `is_genai_related` key:

```
Raw LLM response: Here is the JSON response:

````
{
    "is_genai_related": false,
    "relevance_type": "none"
}
````
```

The problem is that your `parse_llm_response` function is looking for JSON enclosed in triple backticks with the word "json" (` ```json\n...\n``` `).  The LLM is *not* including those.  This is a classic example of the LLM not *quite* following instructions.

**The Fix (Simplified Parsing):**

Since the LLM is reliably returning plain JSON (without the extra formatting), we can simplify `parse_llm_response` dramatically. We *don't* need the regex for the backticks anymore.

```python:Reddit-Agent.ipynb
def parse_llm_response(response_text: str) -> dict:
    """
    Parse LLM response to separate thinking process and JSON response from 
    analyze_genai_relevance()
    """
    print(f"Raw LLM response: {response_text}")  # Keep this for now, in case of further issues

    # Pattern for think tags (keep this, in case the LLM adds thinking later)
    think_pattern = r'<think>(.*?)</think>'
    thinking = re.search(think_pattern, response_text, re.DOTALL)
    thinking = thinking.group(1).strip() if thinking else ""

    # Simplified JSON parsing:  Just try to parse the whole response as JSON
    try:
        # Find the start of the JSON
        json_start = response_text.find('{')
        if json_start == -1:  # No '{' found
            raise json.JSONDecodeError("No JSON object found", response_text, 0)
        json_data = json.loads(response_text[json_start:])
    except json.JSONDecodeError as e:
        print(f"Error: Invalid JSON returned from LLM: {response_text}\nError Detail: {e}")
        json_data = {"is_genai_related": False, "relevance_type": "none"}

    return {
        "thinking": thinking,
        "response": json_data
    }
```

**Explanation of Changes:**

1.  **Removed `json_pattern`:** We no longer need the regex that looks for triple backticks.
2.  **Direct `json.loads()`:** We attempt to parse the entire `response_text` (or, more precisely, the part of it starting with the first `{`) as JSON directly.
3. **Find start of JSON:** Added `response_text.find('{')` to find the beginning of the JSON object. This handles cases where the LLM includes leading text before the JSON.
4.  **`json.JSONDecodeError` Handling:** The `try...except` block is still crucial for handling cases where the LLM *doesn't* return valid JSON.
5. **Kept thinking pattern:** We keep the thinking pattern in case the model starts including it.

**Why this works:**

The LLM is reliably returning a string that *contains* a valid JSON object.  By simply calling `json.loads()` on the relevant part of the string, we can parse the JSON correctly, without relying on the unreliable backtick delimiters.

**Steps:**

1.  **Replace `parse_llm_response`:** Replace your existing `parse_llm_response` function with the code above.
2.  **Run the notebook:** Run your notebook again. The `KeyError` should now be gone, and the script should proceed correctly.
3. **Remove print (eventually):** Once you're confident the issue is resolved, you can remove the `print(f"Raw LLM response: {response_text}")` line.

This simplified parsing is more robust because it doesn't depend on the LLM precisely following formatting instructions that it might ignore. It focuses on extracting the valid JSON data from the response, which is what we ultimately care about.

### AI (Composer Assistant)

You're *almost* there! The script is running, the VPN is working, and the `KeyError` is gone. Now we have two remaining issues:

1.  **`json.JSONDecodeError: Extra data`:** This error is happening *within* your `parse_llm_response` function, even with the simplified parsing. This means the LLM is *still* adding extra text *after* the valid JSON.
2.  **`403 Client Error: Forbidden`:** This error is happening in `extract_article_content`. A 403 error means the server understands the request but refuses to authorize it. This often happens because of:
    *   **Missing or Incorrect Headers:** The website might require specific headers (like `User-Agent`) to prevent bots.
    *   **IP Blocking:** Even with a VPN, some websites might block known VPN IP addresses.
    *   **Rate Limiting:** The website might be rate-limiting requests.
    * **Geographic Restrictions:** Some websites restrict access based on geographic location, even with a VPN.

**Let's address these one by one:**

**1. Fixing `json.JSONDecodeError: Extra data`**

The LLM is adding extra text (the "Reasoning:") *after* the JSON. We need to extract *only* the JSON object.  The best way to do this is to find the opening and closing curly braces (`{` and `}`) and extract the text between them.

```python:Reddit-Agent.ipynb
def parse_llm_response(response_text: str) -> dict:
    """
    Parse LLM response to separate thinking process and JSON response from 
    analyze_genai_relevance()
    """
    print(f"Raw LLM response: {response_text}")  # Keep for debugging

    # Pattern for think tags (keep this)
    think_pattern = r'<think>(.*?)</think>'
    thinking = re.search(think_pattern, response_text, re.DOTALL)
    thinking = thinking.group(1).strip() if thinking else ""

    # Extract JSON by finding braces
    try:
        start = response_text.find('{')
        end = response_text.rfind('}') + 1  # +1 to include the closing brace
        if start == -1 or end == -1:
            raise json.JSONDecodeError("No valid JSON object found", response_text, 0)
        json_str = response_text[start:end]
        json_data = json.loads(json_str)
    except json.JSONDecodeError as e:
        print(f"Error: Invalid JSON returned from LLM: {response_text}\nError Detail: {e}")
        json_data = {"is_genai_related": False, "relevance_type": "none"}

    return {
        "thinking": thinking,
        "response": json_data
    }
```

**Explanation of Changes:**

*   **`start = response_text.find('{')`:** Finds the index of the *first* opening curly brace.
*   **`end = response_text.rfind('}') + 1`:** Finds the index of the *last* closing curly brace, and adds 1 to include the brace itself.
*   **`json_str = response_text[start:end]`:** Extracts the substring between the braces. This is now our JSON string.
* **Error Handling:** If either brace isn't found, it raises a `JSONDecodeError`.

This approach is much more robust to extra text before or after the JSON object.

**2. Fixing `403 Client Error: Forbidden` in `extract_article_content`**

You already have headers in `extract_article_content`, which is good.  Here's a refined version with more robust error handling and a few additional strategies:

```python:Reddit-Agent.ipynb
def extract_article_content(url: str) -> str:
    """Extract main content from article URL with proper headers and error handling"""
    try:
        headers = {
            'User-Agent': 'Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/91.0.4472.124 Safari/537.36',
            'Accept': 'text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/webp,*/*;q=0.8',
            'Accept-Language': 'en-US,en;q=0.5',
            'Connection': 'keep-alive',
        }

        response = requests.get(url, headers=headers, timeout=15)  # Increased timeout slightly
        response.raise_for_status()  # Raise HTTPError for bad responses (4xx or 5xx)

        soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'html.parser')
        for script in soup(["script", "style"]):
            script.decompose()
        text = soup.get_text(separator=' ', strip=True)
        return ' '.join(text.split())

    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
        print(f"Error extracting content: {e}")  # More specific error
        return ""
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Unexpected error extracting content: {e}")
        return ""
```

**Changes and Explanations:**

*   **`requests.exceptions.RequestException`:** This catches a wider range of `requests` errors (including `HTTPError`, `Timeout`, `ConnectionError`, etc.), providing more informative error messages.
*   **Increased `timeout`:**  Slightly increased the timeout to 15 seconds.
* **More Specific Error Message:** Prints the specific exception `e`.

**Further Steps if 403 Persists:**

1.  **Try Different `User-Agent` Strings:**  Some websites are very sensitive to the `User-Agent`.  Try a different browser's `User-Agent` string.  You can find lists of common `User-Agent` strings online.  For example:

    ```python
    'User-Agent': 'Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:90.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/90.0'
    ```

2.  **Rotate `User-Agent` (Advanced):** If you're making many requests, you could create a list of `User-Agent` strings and randomly choose one for each request. This makes your script look less like a bot.

3.  **Try a Different VPN Server:** If you suspect IP blocking, switch to a different server location within your VPN.

4.  **Check `robots.txt`:**  Look at the website's `robots.txt` file (e.g., `https://www.bloomberg.com/robots.txt`). This file tells web crawlers which parts of the site they are allowed to access.  It might give you clues about why you're getting a 403.

5. **Consider using a web scraping service:** If you continue to have trouble with 403 errors, you might consider using a web scraping service (like ScrapingBee, Zyte, etc.). These services handle things like rotating proxies, User-Agents, and CAPTCHA solving, which can be necessary for scraping some websites.

**Implementation:**

1.  **Replace `parse_llm_response`:** Use the updated version above.
2.  **Replace `extract_article_content`:** Use the updated version above.
3.  **Run and Test:** Run your notebook.
4.  **If 403 persists:** Try the additional steps (different `User-Agent`, VPN server, etc.).

By combining the robust JSON parsing with the improved error handling in `extract_article_content`, your script should be much more reliable. The 403 error is the trickiest, but the steps above give you a good path to resolving it.

### AI (Composer Assistant)

Okay, it's working! Excellent. You've successfully navigated a series of tricky issues (certificate problems, network blocking, LLM quirks, and website access restrictions).  The output shows the script correctly identifying one GenAI-related article and generating a summary.

Now, let's clean up the code and make it more robust and tailored to your specific use case. Here's a breakdown of the redundancies and improvements we can make, along with the updated code:

**Redundancies and Improvements:**

1.  **Unnecessary `print` Statements:** We added several `print` statements for debugging.  We can remove most of these now.
2.  **Repeated Reasoning (LLM Output):** The LLM is sometimes including "Reasoning:" *outside* the JSON, and sometimes *inside*. We've already fixed the parsing to handle the extra text *outside*, but we can improve the prompt to encourage the LLM to put the reasoning *inside* the JSON, where it belongs.
3.  **`extract_article_content` Failures:** The 403 errors are still happening for some URLs. We'll keep the improved error handling, but we should also add a check for an empty content string *before* passing it to the summarization functions. This prevents errors if an article can't be fetched.
4.  **`get_reddit_trends` Logic:** The logic in `get_reddit_trends` can be simplified. We can iterate through the posts and *only* process the ones that are GenAI-related.
5. **Unnecessary `parse_llm_response`:** Since the LLM is now (mostly) returning clean JSON, and we've handled the "Reasoning" issue, we can eliminate the `parse_llm_response` function entirely and do the JSON parsing directly within `analyze_genai_relevance`. This makes the code cleaner and easier to follow.
6. **Prompt Improvement:** We can refine the prompt in `analyze_genai_relevance` to be even more explicit about the JSON format and to include the reasoning *within* the JSON.
7. **`create_email_summary` Input:** The `create_email_summary` function takes a `trends_list` as input. We should make sure this list only contains GenAI-related trends.

**Revised Code:**

Here's the updated code, incorporating all the improvements. I'm providing the *entire* notebook content here, for completeness, so you can copy and paste it directly.

**Key Changes in the Code:**

*   **Removed `parse_llm_response`:**  JSON parsing is now done directly in `analyze_genai_relevance`.
*   **Improved `analyze_genai_relevance`:**
    *   More explicit prompt about JSON format, including "reasoning".
    *   Uses brace-finding for robust JSON extraction.
    *   Returns a dictionary with default values on error.
*   **Simplified `get_reddit_trends`:**
    *   Iterates through posts and *only* processes GenAI-related ones.
    *   Adds a check for empty content before summarizing.
    *   Includes the `relevance_reasoning` in the trend data.
*   **`create_email_summary` Input:** Now only receives GenAI-related trends.
*   **Removed Unnecessary `print` Statements:**  Cleaned up the output.
* **Kept Error Handling:** The `try...except` blocks are still in place for robustness.

This revised code is cleaner, more efficient, and more robust to variations in LLM output and website access issues. It's also more focused on your specific use case (identifying and summarizing GenAI trends). It addresses all the issues identified in the previous output and incorporates best practices for error handling and code clarity.

### AI (Composer Assistant)

Okay, this output is *much* better!  The script is running, and it's correctly determining that *none* of the articles are GenAI-related (except for one, which we'll discuss).  The main issue now is a new one: **`Error in GenAI relevance: 404 page not found`**.  This is happening within your `analyze_genai_relevance` function, and it's *not* related to web scraping.

**Understanding the 404 in `analyze_genai_relevance`**

A 404 error *inside* `analyze_genai_relevance` means the *LLM API endpoint* is returning a 404. This is very different from a 404 when scraping a webpage. This almost certainly means there's a problem with either:

1.  **The `model` parameter:** You've specified `"meta/llama-3.1-405b-instruct"` as the model. This looks like a typo, or an incorrect model name. It should likely be a valid model name from your chosen provider (NVIDIA, in this case).
2.  **Your API Key/Account:** It's possible (though less likely, given that it worked before) that there's an issue with your API key, account permissions, or billing.
3. **NVIDIA API Changes:** It's *possible* (but less likely) that NVIDIA has changed their API endpoint or model naming conventions.

**The Fix (and a Model Suggestion)**

The most likely culprit is the `model` parameter. Let's fix that first. Since you're using the NVIDIA API key, I'm going to assume you want to use a model hosted by NVIDIA. I'll suggest a likely model name, but you should **double-check the NVIDIA AI Playground or documentation to confirm the correct model identifier for the model you want to use.**

Here's the corrected `analyze_genai_relevance` function, with a likely model name and the error handling moved to be *more* specific:

```python:Reddit-Agent.ipynb
def analyze_genai_relevance(llm: OpenAI, title: str) -> dict:
    """Analyze if title is GenAI-related using LLM, returning JSON directly."""

    system_prompt = """You are a helpful AI assistant. Determine if the given article title relates to Generative AI.

    Return a JSON object in the following format:
    {
        "is_genai_related": true/false,
        "relevance_type": "direct/indirect/none",
        "reasoning": "Your reasoning here..."
    }
    """
    try:
        response = llm.chat.completions.create(
            model="mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1",  # Corrected model name (EXAMPLE!)
            messages=[
                {"role": "system", "content": system_prompt},
                {"role": "user", "content": title}
            ],
            temperature=0.2,
            top_p=0.7,
            max_tokens=200
        )
        response_text = response.choices[0].message.content

        # Extract JSON by finding braces
        start = response_text.find('{')
        end = response_text.rfind('}') + 1  # +1 to include the closing brace
        if start == -1 or end == -1:
            raise json.JSONDecodeError("No valid JSON object found", response_text, 0)
        json_str = response_text[start:end]
        json_data = json.loads(json_str)

    except json.JSONDecodeError as e:
        print(f"Error: Invalid JSON returned from LLM: {response_text}\nError Detail: {e}")
        json_data = {"is_genai_related": False, "relevance_type": "none", "reasoning": ""}
    except Exception as e: # Catch API errors here
        print(f"Error in GenAI relevance: {e}")
        json_data = {"is_genai_related": False, "relevance_type": "none", "reasoning": ""}

    return json_data # Return the dictionary directly
```

**Key Changes:**

*   **`model="mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1"`:**  I've changed the model to `mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1`.  **This is an example.** You *must* replace this with the correct model name from the NVIDIA AI Playground.  It's likely *not* `meta/llama-3.1-405b-instruct`.
*   **Error Handling:** The `try...except` block now specifically catches exceptions *during the API call* (`llm.chat.completions.create`) and provides a more informative error message.  The JSON parsing error handling is kept separate.
* **Direct Return:** The function now returns the `json_data` dictionary directly, making it cleaner.

**Steps to Fix:**

1.  **Find the Correct Model Name:** Go to the NVIDIA AI Playground (or wherever you manage your NVIDIA AI models) and find the *exact* identifier for the model you want to use.
2.  **Replace the Model Name:** Replace `"mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1"` in the code above with the correct model name.
3.  **Run the Notebook:** Run your notebook again. The 404 error within `analyze_genai_relevance` should be gone.

**Regarding the One GenAI Article:**

The script *did* correctly identify "Lawyers Caught Citing AI-Hallucinated Cases..." as GenAI-related. However, it *didn't* summarize it because the `if relevance["is_genai_related"]:` condition was *outside* the `if content:` block. Because of the earlier 403 errors when fetching content, `content` was often empty, so the summarization was skipped. The previous code update fixes this.

**The Markdown Lint Errors:**

The errors you're seeing that start with `[{ "resource": "/d:/Projects/...` are from a Markdown linter (probably a VS Code extension). These are warnings about your `README.md` file, *not* your Python code. They're telling you about formatting issues in your Markdown:

*   **MD041:** The first line of your README should be a top-level heading (`#`).
*   **MD032:** Lists should have blank lines around them.
*   **MD009:** You have trailing spaces at the end of some lines.
*   **MD022:** Headings should have blank lines above and below them.
* **MD012:** You have multiple blank lines in a row.

These Markdown errors are *unrelated* to the Python errors you were having. You can fix them by editing your `README.md` file to follow the Markdown linting rules, or you can disable the Markdown linter if you don't care about these warnings. They won't affect the execution of your Python script.

By fixing the model name in `analyze_genai_relevance`, you should be back to a fully working script!

i do have the correct model name as i have spceified in @llm-example.py 

---

### AI (Composer Assistant)

You are absolutely right! My apologies, I missed that you had provided a working example with the correct model name in `llm-example.py`.  I should have connected that.  The 404 error *is* still happening in `analyze_genai_relevance`, and since you *do* have a working example, the problem is almost certainly within how the `OpenAI` client is being initialized and used within the `RedditAIAnalysisAgent` class.

The key difference is that your `llm-example.py` sets the `base_url` and `api_key` *directly* when creating the `OpenAI` client:

```python
client = OpenAI(
  base_url = "https://integrate.api.nvidia.com/v1",
  api_key = "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"
)
```

However, in your `RedditAIAnalysisAgent` class, you're relying on environment variables and passing the API key to the `initialize_llm_client` method, but you're *not* setting the `base_url`. The `OpenAI` client, when used with NVIDIA's API, *needs* that `base_url` to be set correctly.  It won't default to the NVIDIA endpoint.

**The Fix (Setting `base_url`)**

You need to set the `base_url` when you initialize the `OpenAI` client within the `initialize_llm_client` method.

Here's the corrected `RedditAIAnalysisAgent` class (specifically the `initialize_llm_client` and `analyze_genai_relevance` methods):

````python:Reddit-Agent.ipynb
class RedditAIAnalysisAgent:
    """Agent to analyze Reddit trends using ReAct reasoning and OpenAI LLM"""

        return json_data # Return the dictionary directly
// ... rest of RedditAIAnalysisAgent class ...
````

**Explanation of Changes:**

*   **`initialize_llm_client`:**  The `base_url` is now explicitly set when creating the `OpenAI` client.  This is the crucial fix.
* **`analyze_genai_relevance`:** Uses the correct model name.

**Steps to Implement:**

1.  **Replace `initialize_llm_client`:**  Use the updated version above within your `RedditAIAnalysisAgent` class.
2.  **Run the Notebook:** Run your notebook. The 404 error *within* `analyze_genai_relevance` should now be resolved.  The script should correctly identify GenAI-related articles and summarize them.

This should fix the 404 error and get your script fully working! You were very close, and providing the working example code was the key to spotting the missing `base_url`.

### User

can we just turn it from a ipynb into structured ?multiple codes file

---

### AI (Composer Assistant)

Yes, absolutely! Converting the Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) into a set of structured Python files (`.py`) is an excellent step for making the project more maintainable, testable, and deployable. Here's how we'll structure the project and the code for each file:

**Project Structure:**

We'll create a directory (e.g., `reddit_analyzer`) with the following structure:

```
reddit_analyzer/
├── reddit_analyzer/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── config.py
│   ├── clients.py
│   ├── utils.py
│   ├── agent.py
│   └── main.py
├── .env  (optional, for storing secrets)
└── README.md (optional, but good practice)
```

**File Breakdown and Code:**

1.  **`reddit_analyzer/__init__.py`:**
    *   This file makes the `reddit_analyzer` directory a Python package. It can be empty or contain package-level imports/initialization.  For now, we'll keep it empty.

    ````python:reddit_analyzer/__init__.py
    ````

2.  **`reddit_analyzer/config.py`:**
    *   This file will hold configuration settings, including API keys and other parameters. This makes it easy to change settings without modifying the code.  It also separates sensitive information from the main code.

    ````python:reddit_analyzer/config.py
    import os
    from dotenv import load_dotenv

    # Load environment variables
    load_dotenv()

    REDDIT_CREDS = {
        "client_id": os.getenv("REDDIT_CLIENT_ID"),
        "client_secret": os.getenv("REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET"),
        "user_agent": os.getenv("REDDIT_USER_AGENT"),
    }

    NVIDIA_API_KEY = os.getenv("NVIDIA_API_KEY")
    NVIDIA_BASE_URL = "https://integrate.api.nvidia.com/v1"  # Add base URL here
    MODEL_NAME = "meta/llama-3.1-405b-instruct"  # Centralize model name
    SUBREDDIT = "technology"  # Add subreddit here
    NUM_POSTS = 20  # Number of posts to fetch
    ```

3.  **`reddit_analyzer/clients.py`:**
    *   This file will contain the functions for initializing the Reddit and OpenAI clients. This separates the client initialization logic from the agent.

    ````python:reddit_analyzer/clients.py

6.  **`reddit_analyzer/main.py`:**
    *   This file will be the entry point of your application. It will create an instance of the agent and run it.

    ````python:reddit_analyzer/main.py
    from reddit_analyzer.agent import RedditAIAnalysisAgent

    def main():
        """Main function to run the Reddit AI Analysis Agent."""
        agent = RedditAIAnalysisAgent()
        result = agent.run()
        print(result) #print the final result

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        main()
    ````

**How to Run:**

1.  **Create the Directory Structure:** Create the `reddit_analyzer` directory and the subdirectories/files as shown above.
2.  **Copy the Code:** Copy the code for each file into the corresponding file.
3.  **Install Dependencies:** Make sure you have the required libraries installed:
    ```bash
    pip install praw openai beautifulsoup4 requests python-dotenv
    ```
4.  **Set Environment Variables:** Create a `.env` file in the *root* `reddit_analyzer` directory (next to the inner `reddit_analyzer` folder) and add your API keys:

    ```
    REDDIT_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
    REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
    REDDIT_USER_AGENT=your_user_agent
    NVIDIA_API_KEY=your_nvidia_api_key
    ```
    Replace `your_client_id`, `your_client_secret`, `your_user_agent`, and `your_nvidia_api_key` with your actual credentials.
5.  **Run from the Terminal:** Navigate to the *outer* `reddit_analyzer` directory (the one containing `main.py`) in your terminal and run:

    ```bash
    python -m reddit_analyzer.main
    ```
    The `-m` flag tells Python to run the `main` module within the `reddit_analyzer` package.

**Key Improvements:**

*   **Modularity:** The code is now organized into logical modules (config, clients, utils, agent, main), making it easier to understand, maintain, and extend.
*   **Configuration:** Settings are centralized in `config.py`, making it easy to change them without modifying the code.
*   **Separation of Concerns:** Each file has a specific responsibility, improving code clarity.
*   **Testability:** The individual functions and classes are now much easier to test in isolation.
*   **Readability:** The code is cleaner and more organized.
*   **Runnable as a Script:** You can now run the project directly from the command line.
* **Package Structure:** The use of `__init__.py` makes the code a proper Python package, which is good practice for larger projects.

This refactoring transforms your project from a single notebook into a well-structured Python application. This is a significant improvement in terms of software engineering best practices.
